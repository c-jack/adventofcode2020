/**
 * Advent of Code 2020
 * Day 5
 * <p>
 * --- Day 5: Binary Boarding ---
 * You board your plane only to discover a new problem: you dropped your boarding pass! You aren't sure which seat is
 * yours, and all of the flight attendants are busy with the flood of people that suddenly made it through passport
 * control.
 * <p>
 * You write a quick program to use your phone's camera to scan all of the nearby boarding passes (your puzzle input);
 * perhaps you can find your seat through process of elimination.
 * <p>
 * Instead of zones or groups, this airline uses binary space partitioning to seat people. A seat might be specified
 * like FBFBBFFRLR, where F means "front", B means "back", L means "left", and R means "right".
 * <p>
 * The first 7 characters will either be F or B; these specify exactly one of the 128 rows on the plane (numbered 0
 * through 127). Each letter tells you which half of a region the given seat is in. Start with the whole list of rows;
 * the first letter indicates whether the seat is in the front (0 through 63) or the back (64 through 127). The next
 * letter indicates which half of that region the seat is in, and so on until you're left with exactly one row.
 * <p>
 * For example, consider just the first seven characters of FBFBBFFRLR:
 * <p>
 * Start by considering the whole range, rows 0 through 127.
 * F means to take the lower half, keeping rows 0 through 63.
 * B means to take the upper half, keeping rows 32 through 63.
 * F means to take the lower half, keeping rows 32 through 47.
 * B means to take the upper half, keeping rows 40 through 47.
 * B keeps rows 44 through 47.
 * F keeps rows 44 through 45.
 * The final F keeps the lower of the two, row 44.
 * The last three characters will be either L or R; these specify exactly one of the 8 columns of seats on the plane
 * (numbered 0 through 7). The same process as above proceeds again, this time with only three steps. L means to keep
 * the lower half, while R means to keep the upper half.
 * <p>
 * For example, consider just the last 3 characters of FBFBBFFRLR:
 * <p>
 * Start by considering the whole range, columns 0 through 7.
 * R means to take the upper half, keeping columns 4 through 7.
 * L means to take the lower half, keeping columns 4 through 5.
 * The final R keeps the upper of the two, column 5.
 * So, decoding FBFBBFFRLR reveals that it is the seat at row 44, column 5.
 * <p>
 * Every seat also has a unique seat ID: multiply the row by 8, then add the column. In this example, the seat has ID
 * 44 * 8 + 5 = 357.
 * <p>
 * Here are some other boarding passes:
 * <p>
 * BFFFBBFRRR: row 70, column 7, seat ID 567.
 * FFFBBBFRRR: row 14, column 7, seat ID 119.
 * BBFFBBFRLL: row 102, column 4, seat ID 820.
 * As a sanity check, look through your list of boarding passes. What is the highest seat ID on a boarding pass?
