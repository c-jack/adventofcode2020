/**
 * Advent of Code 2020
 * Day 13
 * <p>
 * --- Day 13: Shuttle Search ---
 * Your ferry can make it safely to a nearby port, but it won't get much further. When you call to book another ship,
 * you discover that no ships embark from that port to your vacation island. You'll need to get from the port to the
 * nearest airport.
 * <p>
 * Fortunately, a shuttle bus service is available to bring you from the sea port to the airport! Each bus has an ID
 * number that also indicates how often the bus leaves for the airport.
 * <p>
 * Bus schedules are defined based on a timestamp that measures the number of minutes since some fixed reference
 * point in the past. At timestamp 0, every bus simultaneously departed from the sea port. After that, each bus
 * travels to the airport, then various other locations, and finally returns to the sea port to repeat its journey
 * forever.
 * <p>
 * The time this loop takes a particular bus is also its ID number: the bus with ID 5 departs from the sea port at
 * timestamps 0, 5, 10, 15, and so on. The bus with ID 11 departs at 0, 11, 22, 33, and so on. If you are there when
 * the bus departs, you can ride that bus to the airport!
 * <p>
 * Your notes (your puzzle input) consist of two lines. The first line is your estimate of the earliest timestamp you
 * could depart on a bus. The second line lists the bus IDs that are in service according to the shuttle company;
 * entries that show x must be out of service, so you decide to ignore them.
 * <p>
 * To save time once you arrive, your goal is to figure out the earliest bus you can take to the airport. (There will
 * be exactly one such bus.)
 * <p>
 * For example, suppose you have the following notes:
 * <p>
 * 939
 * 7,13,x,x,59,x,31,19
 * Here, the earliest timestamp you could depart is 939, and the bus IDs in service are 7, 13, 59, 31, and 19. Near
 * timestamp 939, these bus IDs depart at the times marked D:
 * <p>
 * time   bus 7   bus 13  bus 59  bus 31  bus 19
 * 929      .       .       .       .       .

 * 949      .       D       .       .       .
 * The earliest bus you could take is bus ID 59. It doesn't depart until timestamp 944, so you would need to wait 944
 * - 939 = 5 minutes before it departs. Multiplying the bus ID by the number of minutes you'd need to wait gives 295.

     * 1789,37,47,1889 first occurs at timestamp 1202161486.
