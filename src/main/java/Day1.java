/**
 * Advent of Code 2020
 * Day 1
 * <p>
 * --- Day 1: Report Repair ---
 * After saving Christmas five years in a row, you've decided to take a vacation at a nice resort on a tropical
 * island. Surely, Christmas will go on without you.
 * <p>
 * The tropical island has its own currency and is entirely cash-only. The gold coins used there have a little
 * picture of a starfish; the locals just call them stars. None of the currency exchanges seem to have heard of them,
 * but somehow, you'll need to find fifty of these coins by the time you arrive so you can pay the deposit on your room.
 * <p>
 * To save your vacation, you need to get all fifty stars by December 25th.
 * <p>
 * Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the
 * second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
 * <p>
 * Before you leave, the Elves in accounting just need you to fix your expense report (your puzzle input);
 * apparently, something isn't quite adding up.
 * <p>
 * Specifically, they need you to find the two entries that sum to 2020 and then multiply those two numbers together.
 * <p>
 * For example, suppose your expense report contained the following:
 * <p>
 * 1721
 * 979
 * 366
 * 299
 * 675
 * 1456
 * In this list, the two entries that sum to 2020 are 1721 and 299. Multiplying them together produces 1721 * 299 =
 * 514579, so the correct answer is 514579.
 * <p>
 * Of course, your expense report is much larger. Find the two entries that sum to 2020; what do you get if you
 * multiply them together?
