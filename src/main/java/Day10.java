/**
 * Advent of Code 2020
 * Day 10
 * <p>
 * --- Day 10: Adapter Array ---
 * Patched into the aircraft's data port, you discover weather forecasts of a massive tropical storm. Before you can
 * figure out whether it will impact your vacation plans, however, your device suddenly turns off!
 * <p>
 * Its battery is dead.
 * <p>
 * You'll need to plug it in. There's only one problem: the charging outlet near your seat produces the wrong number
 * of jolts. Always prepared, you make a list of all of the joltage adapters in your bag.
 * <p>
 * Each of your joltage adapters is rated for a specific output joltage (your puzzle input). Any given adapter can
 * take an input 1, 2, or 3 jolts lower than its rating and still produce its rated output joltage.
 * <p>
 * In addition, your device has a built-in joltage adapter rated for 3 jolts higher than the highest-rated adapter in
 * your bag. (If your adapter list were 3, 9, and 6, your device's built-in adapter would be rated for 12 jolts.)
 * <p>
 * Treat the charging outlet near your seat as having an effective joltage rating of 0.
 * <p>
 * Since you have some time to kill, you might as well test all of your adapters. Wouldn't want to get to your resort
 * and realize you can't even charge your device!
 * <p>
 * If you use every adapter in your bag at once, what is the distribution of joltage differences between the charging
 * outlet, the adapters, and your device?
 * <p>
 * For example, suppose that in your bag, you have adapters with the following joltage ratings:
 * <p>
 * 16
 * 10
 * 15
 * 5
 * 1
 * 11
 * 7
 * 19
 * 6
 * 12
 * 4
 * With these adapters, your device's built-in joltage adapter would be rated for 19 + 3 = 22 jolts, 3 higher than
 * the highest-rated adapter.
 * <p>
 * Because adapters can only connect to a source 1-3 jolts lower than its rating, in order to use every adapter,
 * you'd need to choose them like this:
 * <p>
 * The charging outlet has an effective rating of 0 jolts, so the only adapters that could connect to it directly
 * would need to have a joltage rating of 1, 2, or 3 jolts. Of these, only one you have is an adapter rated 1 jolt
 * (difference of 1).
 * From your 1-jolt rated adapter, the only choice is your 4-jolt rated adapter (difference of 3).
 * From the 4-jolt rated adapter, the adapters rated 5, 6, or 7 are valid choices. However, in order to not skip any
 * adapters, you have to pick the adapter rated 5 jolts (difference of 1).
 * Similarly, the next choices would need to be the adapter rated 6 and then the adapter rated 7 (with difference of
 * 1 and 1).
 * The only adapter that works with the 7-jolt rated adapter is the one rated 10 jolts (difference of 3).
 * From 10, the choices are 11 or 12; choose 11 (difference of 1) and then 12 (difference of 1).
 * After 12, only valid adapter has a rating of 15 (difference of 3), then 16 (difference of 1), then 19 (difference
 * of 3).
 * Finally, your device's built-in adapter is always 3 higher than the highest adapter, so its rating is 22 jolts
 * (always a difference of 3).
 * In this example, when using every adapter, there are 7 differences of 1 jolt and 5 differences of 3 jolts.
 * <p>
 * Here is a larger example:
 * <p>
 * 28
 * 33
 * 18
 * 42
 * 31
 * 14
 * 46
 * 20
 * 48
 * 47
 * 24
 * 23
 * 49
 * 45
 * 19
 * 38
 * 39
 * 11
 * 1
 * 32
 * 25
 * 35
 * 8
 * 17
 * 7
 * 9
 * 4
 * 2
 * 34
 * 10
 * 3
 * In this larger example, in a chain that uses all of the adapters, there are 22 differences of 1 jolt and 10
 * differences of 3 jolts.

     * --- Part Two ---
     * To completely determine whether you have enough adapters, you'll need to figure out how many different ways

     * rules about when adapters can successfully connect still apply.
     * <p>
     * The first example above (the one that starts with 16, 10, 15) supports the following arrangements:
     * <p>
     * (0), 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19, (22)

     * (0), 1, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 16, 19, (22)
     * (0), 1, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19, (22)

     * first example, the total number of arrangements that connect the charging outlet to your device is 8.
