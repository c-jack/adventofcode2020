/**
 * Advent of Code 2020
 * Day 15
 * <p>
 * --- Day 15: Rambunctious Recitation ---
 * You catch the airport shuttle and try to book a new flight to your vacation island. Due to the storm, all direct
 * flights have been cancelled, but a route is available to get around the storm. You take it.
 * <p>
 * While you wait for your flight, you decide to check in with the Elves back at the North Pole. They're playing a
 * memory game and are ever so excited to explain the rules!
 * <p>
 * In this game, the players take turns saying numbers. They begin by taking turns reading from a list of starting
 * numbers (your puzzle input). Then, each turn consists of considering the most recently spoken number:
 * <p>
 * If that was the first time the number has been spoken, the current player says 0.
 * Otherwise, the number had been spoken before; the current player announces how many turns apart the number is from
 * when it was previously spoken.
 * So, after the starting numbers, each turn results in that player speaking aloud either 0 (if the last number is
 * new) or an age (if the last number is a repeat).
 * <p>
 * For example, suppose the starting numbers are 0,3,6:
 * <p>
 * Turn 1: The 1st number spoken is a starting number, 0.
 * Turn 2: The 2nd number spoken is a starting number, 3.
 * Turn 3: The 3rd number spoken is a starting number, 6.
 * Turn 4: Now, consider the last number spoken, 6. Since that was the first time the number had been spoken, the 4th
 * number spoken is 0.
 * Turn 5: Next, again consider the last number spoken, 0. Since it had been spoken before, the next number to speak
 * is the difference between the turn number when it was last spoken (the previous turn, 4) and the turn number of
 * the time it was most recently spoken before then (turn 1). Thus, the 5th number spoken is 4 - 1, 3.
 * Turn 6: The last number spoken, 3 had also been spoken before, most recently on turns 5 and 2. So, the 6th number
 * spoken is 5 - 2, 3.
 * Turn 7: Since 3 was just spoken twice in a row, and the last two turns are 1 turn apart, the 7th number spoken is 1.
 * Turn 8: Since 1 is new, the 8th number spoken is 0.
 * Turn 9: 0 was last spoken on turns 8 and 4, so the 9th number spoken is the difference between them, 4.
 * Turn 10: 4 is new, so the 10th number spoken is 0.
 * (The game ends when the Elves get sick of playing or dinner is ready, whichever comes first.)
 * <p>
 * Their question for you is: what will be the 2020th number spoken? In the example above, the 2020th number spoken
 * will be 436.
 * <p>
 * Here are a few more examples:
 * <p>
 * Given the starting numbers 1,3,2, the 2020th number spoken is 1.
 * Given the starting numbers 2,1,3, the 2020th number spoken is 10.
 * Given the starting numbers 1,2,3, the 2020th number spoken is 27.
 * Given the starting numbers 2,3,1, the 2020th number spoken is 78.
 * Given the starting numbers 3,2,1, the 2020th number spoken is 438.
 * Given the starting numbers 3,1,2, the 2020th number spoken is 1836.
