/**
 * Advent of Code 2020
 * Day 2
 * <p>
 * --- Day 2: Password Philosophy ---
 * Your flight departs in a few days from the coastal airport; the easiest way down to the coast from here is via
 * toboggan.
 * <p>
 * The shopkeeper at the North Pole Toboggan Rental Shop is having a bad day. "Something's wrong with our computers;
 * we can't log in!" You ask if you can take a look.
 * <p>
 * Their password database seems to be a little corrupted: some of the passwords wouldn't have been allowed by the
 * Official Toboggan Corporate Policy that was in effect when they were chosen.
 * <p>
 * To try to debug the problem, they have created a list (your puzzle input) of passwords (according to the corrupted
 * database) and the corporate policy when that password was set.
 * <p>
 * For example, suppose you have the following list:
 * <p>
 * 1-3 a: abcde
 * 1-3 b: cdefg
 * 2-9 c: ccccccccc
 * Each line gives the password policy and then the password. The password policy indicates the lowest and highest
 * number of times a given letter must appear for the password to be valid. For example, 1-3 a means that the
 * password must contain a at least 1 time and at most 3 times.

     * limits of their respective policies.

    /**
     * --- Part Two ---
     * While it appears you validated the passwords correctly, they don't seem to be what the Official Toboggan
     * Corporate Authentication System is expecting.
     * <p>
     * The shopkeeper suddenly realizes that he just accidentally explained the password policy rules from his old
     * job at the sled rental place down the street! The Official Toboggan Corporate Policy actually works a little
     * differently.
     * <p>
     * Each policy actually describes two positions in the password, where 1 means the first character, 2 means the
     * second character, and so on. (Be careful; Toboggan Corporate Policies have no concept of "index zero"!)
     * Exactly one of these positions must contain the given letter. Other occurrences of the letter are irrelevant
     * for the purposes of policy enforcement.
     * <p>
     * Given the same example list from above:
     * <p>
     * 1-3 a: abcde is valid: position 1 contains a and position 3 does not.
     * 1-3 b: cdefg is invalid: neither position 1 nor position 3 contains b.
     * 2-9 c: ccccccccc is invalid: both position 2 and position 9 contain c.
     * <p>
     * How many passwords are valid according to the new interpretation of the policies?
     *
     * Answer: 313
